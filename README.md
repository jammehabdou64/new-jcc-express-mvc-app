- Opinionated project structure for organized code
- Built-in validation for form data
- Single route file for easy route management
- Comes with Handlebars for view rendering
- Includes configuration with MongoDB
- Includes configuration with dotenv

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Usage

To create a new Express.js project using `jcc-express-starter`, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx jcc-express-starter new-express-app
```

This will create a new directory named my-express-app and set up the Express.js application inside it.

Navigate to the newly created directory:

```bash
cd my-express-app
```

Run this command to create an env file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To generate a controller:

```bash
node jcc make:controller UsersController
```

To generate a model:

```bash
node jcc make:model User
```

To generate a request:

```bash
node jcc make:request UserRequest
```

To generate a controller and model:

```bash
node jcc make:controller UsersController User '--resources'
```

Or

```bash
node jcc make:controller UsersController User '-r'
```
